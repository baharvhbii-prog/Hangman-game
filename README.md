#Hangman Game –React.js + TypeScript

A modern Hangman game built with React.js and TypeScript.
On each page refresh, a random word is generated and the player must guess the word before running out of attempts.

Features

- Random word generation on refresh
- Limited number of attempts
- Letter validation (prevent duplicate guesses)
- Win/Lose detection
- Displays the correct word when the player loses
- Visual hangman progression based on remaining attempts

Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- React
- CSS

📍How It Works:

Each time the page reloads, a new random word is selected.
The player guesses letters one by one.
If the player exceeds the allowed number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the correct word is revealed.

What I Learned
